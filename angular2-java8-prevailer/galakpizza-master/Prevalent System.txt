RAM is getting cheaper every day. Researchers are announcing major BreakthroughsInMemoryTechnology.
Even today, servers with multi-gigabyte RAM are commonplace. For many systems it is already feasible to keep all business objects in RAM.         
         
Do you mean I can simply have my objects in RAM and forget all that database hassle?         
That's right.         
         
Are you crazy? What if there's a system crash?         
To avoid losing data, every night, or in any reasonable period, your system server saves a snapshot of all business objects to a file using plain object serialization.         
         
What about the changes occurred since the last snapshot was taken? Won't the system lose those in a crash?         
No. All commands received from the system's clients are converted into serializable objects by the server. 
Before being applied to the business objects, each command is serialized and written to a log file. 
During crash recovery, first, the system retrieves its last saved state from the snapshot file. 
Then, it reads the commands from the log files created since the snapshot was taken. 
These commands are simply applied to the business objects exactly as if they had just come from the system's clients. 
The system is then back in the state it was just before the crash and is ready to run.
