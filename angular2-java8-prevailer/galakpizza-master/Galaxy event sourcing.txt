This is more advanced version of what I have shown on presentation. ( full presentation  from Voxxed Days Belgrade https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-Yp42lVvRo)
It uses Ratpack - there is main method: https://github.com/airomem/galakpizza/blob/master/galakpizza_n/src/main/java/pl/setblack/exp/galakpizza/server/PizzaWebServer.java
There is also benchmark method there

https://github.com/airomem/galakpizza/blob/master/galakpizza_n/src/main/java/pl/setblack/exp/MyBenchmark.java
(Funny I've just realised I  have some "oracle" header there - for I do not know which reason... - maybe from JMH)

And alternative code for hibernate:
https://github.com/airomem/galakpizza/tree/master/galakpizza_h
There is also benchmark method there
BTW. Sorry - I am  not maintaining those as projects - this is only code for presentations and discussions  - so sometimes because of some experimients it may not work - please
let me know if you have problems.

Web is published here:
https://github.com/airomem/galakpizza/tree/master/galakweb2 
(it  uses angular)
npm install 
gulp
gulp dev 


(On presentation I've used Quickie version 
with lot of simplifications (time...)
https://github.com/airomem/galakpizza/tree/quickie/galakpizza_n
it also uses snapshot version of my library (so You would have to compile it on your own:https://github.com/airomem/airomem/tree/master/airomem-core).
BTW. I am not really trying to promote my own library - I am not selling it. It is very simple thing - you can write on your own. And besided it is only a Java8 wrapper for library called prevayler
(which is also very simple). I  just try to promote alternative approach.
